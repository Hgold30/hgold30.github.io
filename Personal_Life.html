	<h1>Personal Life</h1>
		<h3>I was born on July 24, 2001 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to my Kevin and Cindy. I had lived in the capitol of Keystone State my whole entire life before following in the footsteps of my brother and coming to Madison for college. I grew up around the world of sports and would consider them to be a high priority in my life. Although I am definitely not the most athletic person, I was able to compete in Tennis and Basketball at a competitive high school level. Although I grew up in the middle of PA, I was never a fan of Pennsylvania teams. My favorite teams on the professional level include the Green Bay Packers and New York Mets. Aside from sports, I enjoy time outside, being with my friends, and overall making the best out of every situation. </h3>
